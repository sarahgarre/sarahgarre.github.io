      <blockquote>If you want to know more about the role of water used for Flemish agriculture in the context of climate change, you've come to the right place. With this interactive poster I present the importance of water in agriculture for today and tomorrow. How can Flemish agriculture adapt to the consequences of a changing climate on water availability and quality? <br>
      What are the challenges and especially, what are possible solutions? </blockquote>
